# STEP 1 is to import pandas and your file

import pandas as pd

# .head allows you to check that you've uploaded the correct file to work on

# This extracts the feature variable in a list. In this case it's wind
wind_list = jan_raw_data['Wind_Spd_kmh'].tolist()

# This formula sums up every eight numbers (the number of daylight hours), for each day of the month. So x, for Jan 1st for example, would be 8:00, and x+9 would be 16:00.
# This loop is repeated 31 days (there are 31 days in January), and we end up with a list of 31 numbers.
# Remember for indexes you need an additional number because they start at 0, not 1.
# You can think of the x+9 as the hours of daylight.
composite_list_wind = [wind_list[x:x+9] for x in range(0, len(wind_list),9)]

# Now to put the dataframe that contains all three feature variables together:

jan_final_dataframe_dual = pd.DataFrame(jan_final_data_dual, columns = ['Day', 'Wind Speed (kts)', 'Visibility (sm)', 'Cloud Ceiling (ft)', 'Type of Flight'])

jan_final_data_solo = {'Day':day, 'Wind Speed (kts)':avg_wind_per_day_knots, 'Visibility (sm)':avg_vis_per_day_stat_mile, 'Cloud Ceiling (ft)':avg_cc_per_day, 'Type of Flight':solo}
jan_final_dataframe_solo = pd.DataFrame(jan_final_data_solo, columns = ['Day', 'Wind Speed (kts)', 'Visibility (sm)', 'Cloud Ceiling (ft)', 'Type of Flight'])

jan_final_data_xcountry = {'Day':day, 'Wind Speed (kts)':avg_wind_per_day_knots, 'Visibility (sm)':avg_vis_per_day_stat_mile, 'Cloud Ceiling (ft)':avg_cc_per_day, 'Type of Flight':xcountry}
jan_final_dataframe_xcountry = pd.DataFrame(jan_final_data_xcountry, columns = ['Day', 'Wind Speed (kts)', 'Visibility (sm)', 'Cloud Ceiling (ft)', 'Type of Flight'])

# STEP 3 
# I repeated this process 11 more times to get the dataframe for each month. Once you have the code in place its just about running it on 11 more csv files.

# STEP 4
# Combine all month's data into one single csv file named "master_dataset"
